Third : Create a C# project that opens an image from file and prints it’s height and width to console. Upload the code to github.
        Add a README.md that explains what the program does, and a screenshot with an example: image, and console with program’s output. 
        And a link in a post in this doc.


Solution:


 class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Image img = Image.FromFile("C:\\Users\\Sinistraz\\Documents\\C#Repos\\1.1.jpg"); // load the image
            Console.WriteLine(img.Size);                                                     //casual size of picture
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }

P.S. Sorry for so casual solition. I have a little practice with files and Windows Forms at all.
