Task: 

In a separate post explain what the computational complexity of the algorithm is, and why.


Solution:

I think the computational complexity of my algoritm is O(M*N). Where M is a number of letters in first word and N is a number of wotds at all.
If we take 1 million inputing words we can ignore M at all, than the computational complexity would be O(N). This is a linear complexity. 
But if we take  a few words the computational complexity would be O(N*N). All depend of number of inputing words.
